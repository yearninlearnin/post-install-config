<h1>osTicket - Post Configuration Setup</h1>
</p>
This lab demonstrates the process of configuring osTicket .<br />

<p>
To get started with configuring osTicket for use, we will log in using our admin account at http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php
To simulate end users submitting tickets, the end user URL is http://localhost/osTicket/.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<br />

<p>
This is the initial splash page for osTicket. This will be the main portal where admins and users with elevated privaledges will be able to sign in to manage tickets.

<p>
Here is the homepage of the ticketing software. This is our main portal where we can view open and closed tickets. From here I will begin adding some team members with elevated privilages to act as support engineers as well as adding a couple of end users to who will simulate on primise support requests.
